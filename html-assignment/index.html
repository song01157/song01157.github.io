    Hi, My name is Danyang Song,I come from China and I'm 19 years old this year. For this year, it's my first universtiy life year in Algonquin College and I'm glad to see many new classmates in school. About my habits,
    I like to play basketball, draw some pictures,<abbr>PS </abbr>and design many interesting things. Although, sometimes I can't do anythings well, I always will try my best to do these things well! Because I believe in myself.

     For my first universtity year, I chose the program which named Interactive Media Design, because this major involves "design" and I very like design. I like to know more interesting things which I haven't seen
     before and design more interesting things. I know it's not easy to design somethings great, but I like challenges, because I once heard a famous sentence before is
