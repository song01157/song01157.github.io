Introduction:

For design, because of the interactive media course I took this semester, so I set up a institute website about interactive media with the subject of my major.

For website content, I created a total of four web pages, the first is Homepage, I added the animation function of the slides, and put the slides behind the introduction text, which is more convenient for users to watch and understand. The second is About page, I made a member introduction in the form of an animation of a flip card. I think it looks mysterious and interesting, and I added tips to remind the customer at the top of the member card. The third page shows the portfolio, corresponding to the results of each research content listed on the homepage. The fourth is the contact page, which is convenient for customers to raise any questions to the institute. And they can submit a form to ask questions, then, at the bottom, I also added other detailed information about the institute designed.

Then I added the characteristic discourse "We are committed to interactive media design." of the institute website I designed on almost every page. This is also one of the characteristics that can highlight the institute's different characteristics.

I think that creating an interactive media webpage is also an interesting challenge. I have used the knowledge we have learned. At the same time, in order to make this website look more authentic, I used some animations and borrowed some pictures and materials. I think The most interesting place I created is the flip card on the About page, which makes the introduction of people on the site look more interesting. I think I still need to improve the viewing effect of the overall page, but in the future, I will work harder to make the visual effect of the web page better and better.
